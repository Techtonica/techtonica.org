# Techtonica
This repo is for [the Techtonica website](http://techtonica.org), which is currently hosted on Bluehost.

### Who
The main audience of the website is made up of (potential) volunteers and sponsors. (Students will be contacted via local organizations.)

### What
We need to effectively communicate that Techtonica and its students are worth supporting.

### How
There should be a good understanding of how the program works with vetting, training, mentoring, and hiring.
