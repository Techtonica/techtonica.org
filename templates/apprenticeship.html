          <p>Techtonica's software engineering apprenticeship program is six months of free, intensive, hands-on tech learning for local women and non-binary adults with low incomes.

          <h1 class="blue-h1">The Program</h1>
          <p class="justify">Techtonica's apprenticeship program is a free, full-time, six-month program that provides the opportunity for local women and non-binary, femme adults with low incomes to learn technical skills and start their first job in tech. We select apprentices who are independent but good at collaborating, motivated to succeed, dedicated to the commitment of learning to code, flexible, curious, open-minded, and excited for long-term careers in the field, have a good attitude and a growth mindset, can calmly manage extended periods of frustration (troubleshooting is something you'll face forever in tech!), and want to pay it forward. We aim to empower those most underrepresented in tech and to help tech become more diverse and inclusive.</p>
          <p class="justify">The program runs Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM for six months in San Francisco, starting in January and July. After the first trial month of full-time training, participants who work the hardest and meet and exceed expectations will be invited to continue for the last five months with stipends based upon need and funding available. (We still recommend you save up as much as possible as stipends may not cover all your costs.)</p>
          <p class="justify">Techtonica apprentices will learn to do full-stack web development using JavaScript. Upon successful completion of the program, as many apprentices as possible are placed with partner companies via a two-way interview and rating system.</p>
          <p class="justify">What bootcamps and Techtonica have in common is the fact that they are intensive training. However, bootcamps can be pretty passive classroom learning with students and they cost between $15,000 and $30,000. Techtonica aims to be more like the workplace to make the transition into the industry better—instead of having an instructor constantly guiding you (which you won't have in any software engineering job), you are given a general schedule of topics and assignments (see [our curriculum repo](https://github.com/techtonica/curriculum) for an idea of the resources provided) and you're expected to figure out what to do on your own or in collaboration with volunteers, mentors, tech groups, and other apprentices. Because our resources are open-source, they are continuously being improved and you can even make improvements as you work through them. In the best jobs, there are regular check-ins with very understanding managers and mentors provide regular support, but that is not always the case. Techtonica’s program is as hands-on and project-based as possible to best prepare you for work in tech. You'll also be expected to speak and present in front of people often—a very useful skill to have for a successful career.
          </p>
          <p class="justify">The schedule includes assessments to give you a reason to review what you've learned, to provide you with feedback on where you need to improve, and to prepare you for successful placement. As we consider your progress, we take everything you do in the program into account (not just assessments)—if you're on time and present, if you're meeting deadlines, if you're completing assignments, if you're following process, if you're communicating about your needs, if you're consistently meeting with your mentors, if you're building your network, if you're collaborating well, if you're solving problems, if you're dealing with the stress of an intensive program well, if you're lifting others with you, if you're reading instructions, how your mentor feels you're doing, how you indicate you're doing in surveys and one-on-ones, etc. If we see any indications you’re struggling in one area, we look more closely at everything else and we seek a plan for improvement. Consistent problems and lack of improvement could indicate someone’s not ready to continue the program. The board discusses such cases to decide what should be done.</p>
          <p class="justify">Intensive programs, career transitions, and learning and working with technical concepts—these are all stressful, difficult things. If we accept you to our program, we believe in your ability to step up to the challenge, and you should believe in that ability and look at every new step as something preparing you for tech. In many ways, tech will be much harder than this program and this is your chance to work out how you’re going to react when faced with bigger challenges. Are you able to train yourselves to calmly accept challenges, to open your minds to growth, and to learn whatever’s needed to succeed?</p>
