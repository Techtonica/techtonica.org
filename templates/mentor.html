    <p>
      Techtonica is a rigorous, virtual technical training program followed by job
      placement for women and non-binary adults with low incomes. Our program
      participants will benefit from the experience, insight, and support of
      someone who understands their desire to become software engineers and has
      successfully achieved that goal themselves. To improve our participants’
      probability of success, we pair them with a mentor who can serve in the
      following roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Advisor – Mentors volunteer their professional wisdom, give feedback on
        projects, and are available to be a sounding board for mentees’ ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Role Model – A mentor’s insight into their professional journey helps
        mentees see their own path into a new career.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supporter – Learning to code can be a difficult and frustrating
        endeavor. It is incredibly important to have a volunteer mentor who
        listens with a sympathetic ear, acknowledges disappointments, and
        celebrates triumphs.

      Our mentors play a significant role in supporting our participants on
      their tech growth journey! Here are some testimonials:
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I enjoy our weekly mentoring session, as it provides me a chance to
      summarize my wins, my confusion and talk about my burnout. Especially it
      provides me a chance to practice my presentation skills as I have to show
      my project to my mentor, talk about my designs and special tech knowledge
      I applied to it" -Techtonica participant
    </p>
    <p>
      "I’m very grateful for the support I’m receiving- the encouragement makes
      me feel inspired to keep learning and helps me feel less scared to ask
      questions in the future" -Techtonica participant
    </p>
    <p>
      "I also love the mentors: I had 2, and I felt so honored to be learning
      from them. They were both senior people in the field with a passion for
      teaching, and they gave me so much insight into the industry and helped me
      learn so much faster." -Techtonica participant
