      Techtonica is a rigorous, six-month training program followed by job
      placement for women and non-binary adults with low incomes. Our
      program participants will benefit from the experience, insight, and
      support of someone who understands their desire to become software
      engineers and has successfully achieved that goal themselves. To improve
      our participants’ probability of success, we pair them with a mentor who
      can serve in the following roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Advisor – Mentors share their professional wisdom, give feedback on
        projects, and are available to be a sounding board for mentees’ ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Role Model – A mentor’s insight into their professional journey helps
        mentees see their own path into a new career.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supporter – Learning to code can be a difficult and frustrating
        endeavor. It is incredibly important to have a mentor who listens with a
        sympathetic ear, acknowledges disappointments, and celebrates triumphs.
