                      Techtonica has an incredible mission dedicated to getting
                      underrepresented people into tech. Being tuition-free, this is a rare opportunity in the bootcamp sphere. Additionally, there is an equal emphasis on soft skills, the interviewing process, and mental health to the actual coding, which is an experience you may not receive at any other bootcamp. At the end of the curriculum, we get matched with a paid internship with a sponsor company that best fits the student's interests. The staff at Techtonica is determined to get you your first position in tech. Techtonica is extremely open to feedback and implements it immediately. Less

                   Techtonica has changed my life. I applied for the program looking for guidance and support in my journey of learning to code and getting a job in tech. There are so many resources available online, and I felt overwhelmed because I wasn't sure what to learn next. That's when I decided to look for a bootcamp. I discovered Techtonica via word of mouth and decided to apply. The application process is really thorough and a great pre-cursor for what the program is like. The curriculum is non-traditional. There are no lectures or grades, which I and all of my cohort mates appreciated. The staff at Techtonica encourage
                   participants to learn in the way that works best for them. Yes, I learned how to become a full stack web developer with Techtonica, but the greatest skill I was taught was how to learn hard subjects quickly. And for that reason, I encourage others to apply.’"

                 A great way to break into tech!
                 My overall message to people about Techtonica (women, non-binary, femme identity) is that this is a great way to get your foot in the door in tech! There are many coding bootcamps, many of which charge *a lot of money with no meaningful job opportunities. This does not describe Techtonica. Techtonica is not a cookie cutter academic course/bootcamp, it is a very practical preparation for the actual job. You will need to be able to self-learn with the help of the engineering manager, volunteer mentors, cohort mates, & free online resources/Etc.
                 You will be guided to learn the fundamentals of software development, practice coding challenges (leading up to leetcode), and will build up a portfolio of projects!!!’"

                  This changed my life
                  Techtonica wants its participants to be successful. The staff is incredibly supportive and realistic, even when you have full-blown imposter syndrome.
                  They are trying to #BridgeTheTechGap and help low-income women and nonbinary folks (everybody but cis- men) get into tech. Also, because the program lasts 6 months, you can still have a life outside of your computer (extra great for parents, people with other obligations, people who are trying to not burn out in tech before even getting started).
                  In fact, they encourage you to have a work-life balance and to know what you deserve in your upcoming tech career. A year ago, I was doing something else entirely, not at all related to tech, and now I'm a Software Engineer at Sony. All you really need is to be ready and willing to work with others, to not be afraid of independent learning, and to be able to ask questions (especially when you're confused!).’"

                 Recommend
                 Business Outlook
                 -You learn full stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node), JavaScript - Possible job placement + good pay + benefits + mentor - Opportunity to learn with a stipend - Soft and Behavioral Skills training - Technical Mentor - Mock Interviews, Code Assessments, and 1:1 Meetings - Guest speakers and events - Code challenge practice - Diverse & Inclusive
                 Cons
                 - Fast-paced - Expected to have SOME basic coding skills to pass the interviews to ENTER - you're expected to ask clarifying questions to receive proper feedback’"

                 Great Program for Career transition to Tech
                 I had a great, positive experience with Techtonica. I joined Techtonica last year (2021), because of some family issues, I thought about quitting the program with a broken heart. But Techtonica gave me an opportunity to work as a curriculum developer(part- time). It really helped me to keep in touch with folks at Techtonica and resume the course the following year. The staff at Techtonica are awesome and available to help throughout and after graduation. Techtoncia has a good work culture, they are friendly, transparent, motivating, collaborative and empathetic. They helped me to get a paid internship. I am alway grateful to Techtonica.
                 Pros: 1. Techtonica is a free, software engineering program for women and non-binary adults.2. They will assign you a mentor, who is going to help you learn programming, code debugging, and review your PRs.3. They will help in Interview preparation (Weekly knowledge check, mock interviews with volunteers)4. Placement with sponsor company’"

                  I was in my last year of undergraduate studies and was dreading my degree. I enjoyed learning and loved what I was studying, but I knew I could not sustain a life doing so. When I stumbled across Techtonica solely by chance, it was an absolute gamechanger. Techtonica had checked all the boxes: - free, with the option of a stipend when need is demonstrated - 6-month extensive remote bootcamp with a 6-month internship after - exclusive to women and non-binary individuals - actively worked towards making cohorts more diverse and inclusive - assigned a mentor - was my chance to make my first step into tech! As I am approaching the end of my time in the bootcamp portion of the program, I am realizing how prepared and well-equipped I am for the new journey ahead of me BECAUSE of Techtonica. The staff have been nothing but supportive, welcoming, and accommodating. The cherry on top was definitely being able to find such a wonderful community in my fellow cohort members.’

                  about its cohort members and made sure that I am doing well.
                  Getting feedbacks regularly really helped me to keep track of my
                  progress and provided me with goals I needed to work on.
                  Working in a collaborative environment helped me to improve my team-building, communicating skills. It's a safe space to begin
                  your Tech journey. Everyone is so friendly and professional. It
                  becomes overwhelming at times, but having meditation sessions
                  really helped me to put my mind at ease. Just trust the process.’"

                and be successful. The staff is awesome and always make themselves available to help or just chat. Other ways in which participants 
                are supported is through mentors. I had two and I learned so much from them. Other mentors are also available during program hours. 
                In regards to the curriculum, at first I felt like things were overwhelming but eventually learned to trust the process, later things 
                started making sense and falling into place. What I learned allowed for me to feel confident in creating many projects (one final 
                project). Another thing I found extremely useful was all the interview prep. I feel like that really helped prepare me for final 
                interviews and have a more realistic expectation for what interviewing in the real world is like. Overall, I am very grateful for 
                this experience and finally being a software engineer!!!'"

                  took for a gamble was actually one of the best decisions I've ever made. PROS: - Curriculum is flexible to your learning style. 
                  - There's a large pool of fantastic mentors and volunteers to help you learn, and they actually work in the industry. 
                  - Stipends help you support yourself so you can focus on your learning and skill development 
                  - Lots of opportunities to network and make connections in the industry.

                because Techtonica not only teaches you a full stack (PERN: Postgres, Express, React and Nodejs) but you also learn how to work in a 
                tech environment by learning how to communicate, learning how to ask for help effectively, how to give/take feedbacks, how to pair 
                program, how agile development works, how to destress, how to overcome imposter syndrome and etc. Theres so much to learn and do 
                which makes it hard but Techtonica knows this, that is why each participant is given their own mentor for support and why there are 
                hundreds of volunteers able to help in a Slack channel when you're stuck and specially why everyone is taught to help each out. The 
                curriculum is solid and the pace is just right and the support after finding a placement is amazing, I hope everyone gets the 
                opportunity to take the same journey I did!'"

                have gained both technically and personal development wise at Techtonica. Our cohort was grateful to have internships with Techtonica's 
                partner companies. We are super excited to be starting this next chapter of our software development journey. I feel so grateful to be 
                able to be connected with a 6 month internship through Techtonica. It can be very difficult to get that first job/internship right 
                after a bootcamp and Techtonica aims to break that barrier down.'"

                The best part of the program is that each student gets matched with a personal technical mentor, who helps with the weekly projects, 
                answer technical questions and help to debug. Techtonica staff was also very supportive, and students could address any problems/issues 
                they had. Another great thing about Techtonica, is that the program does not only teach coding but also trains students for behavioral 
                interviews and develop soft skills. Every week we had mock interviews with Techtonica staff, and we had a lot of opportunities to 
                practice interviewing with volunteers from tech companies. I am so happy that I got to know about this amazing program and decided to 
                join. Next week, I am going to graduate from Techtonica, and I got an internship for a back-end role in one of the Techtonica sponsor

                in the tech industry. You will need to be self reliant as this program is not like a normal / traditional higher education environment. 
                There are no daily lectures and you will required to find the best way for you to grasp and understand the material. There are 
                resources provided to assist with questions and tech help though so you are not left completely in the dark. If you have the chance to

This program is intense but beautiful. I went in expecting to of course learn Javascript, but came out with so much more. We learned the PERN stack, how to collaborate with others, how to work with github, the terminal being ur friend and not your foe, but also how to set boundaries, advocate for yourself, and how to give feedback in a professional setting that translates beautifully into every day life. There was also no shortage of guest speakers that did a great job at showing the diversity in the industry job wise. Just so much. The curriculum was solid but with the amount of time we have for the program, u can only spend so much time on each concept. You are able to put things into practice right away though which helps it stick.'"
