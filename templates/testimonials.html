                "My cohort members have become friends and constant inspiration
                – they're passionate, creative, and endlessly supportive.
                They've encouraged me to push myself and grow in ways I hadn't
                expected. Michelle Glauser, our program Founder and CEO, is warm
                and attentive, and her focus on constructive feedback is
                something I know will have a lasting impact on me."

                "Techtonica has changed my life. I applied for the program 
                looking for guidance and support in my journey of learning 
                to code and getting a job in tech. There are so many resources 
                available online, and I felt overwhelmed because I wasn't 
                sure what to learn next. That's when I decided to look for 
                a bootcamp. I discovered Techtonica via word of mouth and 
                decided to apply. The application process is really thorough 
                and a great pre-cursor for what the program is like. The 
                curriculum is non-traditional. There are no lectures or 
                grades, which I and all of my cohort mates appreciated. 
                The staff at Techtonica encourage participants to learn 
                in the way that works best for them. Yes, I learned how to 
                become a full stack web developer with Techtonica, but the 
                greatest skill I was taught was how to learn hard subjects 
                quickly. And for that reason, I encourage others to apply."

                "My overall message to people about Techtonica (women, 
                non-binary, femme identity) is that this is a great way 
                to get your foot in the door in tech!  There are many 
                coding bootcamps, many of which charge *a lot* of money 
                with no meaningful job opportunities. This does not describe 
                Techtonica. Techtonica is not a cookie cutter academic 
                course/bootcamp, it is a very practical preparation for 
                the actual job. You will need to be able to self-learn with 
                the help of the engineering manager, volunteer mentors, cohort 
                mates, & free online resources/Etc. You will be guided to learn 
                the fundamentals of software development, practice coding 
                challenges (leading up to leetcode), and will build up a portfolio 
                of projects!!!"

                low-income women and nonbinary folks (everybody but cis-men) get into 
                tech. Also, because the program lasts 6 months, you can still have a 
                life outside of your computer (extra great for parents, people with 
                other obligations, people who are trying to not burn out in tech before 
                even getting started). In fact, they encourage you to have a work-life 
                balance and to know what you deserve in your upcoming tech career. A year 
                ago, I was doing something else entirely, not at all related to tech, 
                and now I'm a Software Engineer at Sony. All you really need is to be 
                ready and willing to work with others, to not be afraid of independent 
                learning, and to be able to ask questions (especially when you're confused!)."

                "Invaluable Skills Acquired. Techtonica never stopped giving from 
                the pre-applicant phase study groups to the full PERN stack to the 
                soft skills necessary to thrive in the tech environment. While 
                there are occasionally outdated items in the curriculum, there's 
                a never-ending set of resources and group of mentors ready to help 
                and updates are always getting made as issues are found. Competition 
                to get in was brisk, but I found they accepted a nice mix of skill-levels 
                and personalities for what turned out to be a very balanced cohort. 
                I couldn't have asked for a more generous situation as one of my 
                parents had a terrible stroke early in the program and they actively 
                worked to help me still make it through the program and never penalized 
                me financially for the additional absences necessary in my situation. 
                I personally know people who have applied multiple times and got in, and 
                other people that applied once and got in. The decisions are carefully 
                made and it's obvious how much they apply that care in all areas. I'd 
                like to see more curriculum added around neurodivegency and disability 
                in the workplace, and I believe that feedback will be taken into consideration 
                because feedback works in both directions at Techtonica. I highly recommend 
                this program."

                I could not sustain a life doing so. When I stumbled across Techtonica

                demonstrated, 6-month extensive remote bootcamp with a 6-month internship 
                after, exclusive to women and non-binary individuals, actively worked 
                towards making cohorts more diverse and inclusive, assigned a mentor, was 
                my chance to make my first step into tech! As I am approaching the end of

                and well-equipped I am for the new journey ahead of me BECAUSE of Techtonica. 
                The staff have been nothing but supportive, welcoming, and accommodating.
