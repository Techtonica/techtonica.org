The review is written by Brienna Saje Klassen, a Software Engineer in Training who graduated in 2021. The review itself says, 'Forever grateful for this experience.' 'When I applied, I honestly wasn't expecting much of this program and had little trust that it wasn't more than a scam, but I needed a change in structure. College moves at way too slow of a pace when you're a low-income, single mother living paycheck to paycheck. 6 months later, I'm so happy I applied. What I took for a gamble was actually one of the best decisions I've ever made. PROS: - Curriculum is flexible to your learning style. - There's a large pool of fantastic mentors and volunteers to help you learn, and they actually work in the industry. - Stipends help you support yourself so you can focus on your learning and skill development - Lots of opportunities to network and make connections in the industry. - They simulate a real work environment to prepare you for actual work experiences. - Tons of interview and soft skills practice. Really helps with your confidence. - Exposure to numerous kinds of jobs in the Tech industry.'"

If you are a women or non-binary individual I can not think of another program with the benefits at the same level as Techtonica. You get six months to learn and understand what it means to work in the tech industry. You will need to be self reliant as this program is not like a normal / traditional higher education environment. There are no daily lectures and you will required to find the best way for you to grasp and understand the material. There are resources provided to assist with questions and tech help though so you are not left completely in the dark. If you have the chance to apply I would as this program can change the trajectory of your career and life for the better in the long run.''

The review is written by Lex, a Software Engineer in Training who graduated in 2022. The review itself says, 'An awesome journey that I already miss." Techtonica was a difficult but amazing journey. You learn A LOT because Techtonica not only teaches you a full stack (PERN: Postgres, Express, React and Nodejs) but you also learn how to work in a tech environment by learning how to communicate, learning how to ask for help effectively, how to give/take feedbacks, how to pair program, how agile development works, how to destress, how to overcome imposter syndrome and etc. Theres so much to learn and do which makes it hard but Techtonica knows this, that is why each participant is given their own mentor for support and why there are hundreds of volunteers able to help in a Slack channel when you're stuck and specially why everyone is taught to help each out. The curriculum is solid and the pace is just right and the support after finding a placement is amazing, I hope everyone gets the opportunity to take the same journey I did!'"

While it was very challenging and sometimes I had major impostor syndrome, it is set up in a way to really help participants work through challenges and be successful. The staff is awesome and always make themselves available to help or just chat. Other ways in which participants are supported is through mentors. I had two and I learned so much from them. Other mentors are also available during program hours. In regards to the curriculum, at first I felt like things were overwhelming but eventually learned to trust the process, later things started making sense and falling into place. What I learned allowed for me to feel confident in creating many projects (one final project). Another thing I found extremely useful was all the interview prep. I feel like that really helped prepare me for final interviews and have a more realistic expectation for what interviewing in the real world is like. Overall, I am very grateful for this experience and finally being a software engineer!!!'"

We learned the PERN stack, how to collaborate with others, how to work with github, the terminal being ur friend and not your foe, but also how to set boundaries, advocate for yourself, and how to give feedback in a professional setting that translates beautifully into every day life. There was also no shortage of guest speakers that did a great job at showing the diversity in the industry job wise. Just so much. The curriculum was solid but with the amount of time we have for the program, u can only spend so much time on each concept. You are able to put things into practice right away though which helps it stick.'"

The best part of the program is that each student gets matched with a personal technical mentor, who helps with the weekly projects, answer technical questions and help to debug. Techtonica staff was also very supportive, and students could address any problems/issues they had. Another great thing about Techtonica, is that the program does not only teach coding but also trains students for behavioral interviews and develop soft skills. Every week we had mock interviews with Techtonica staff, and we had a lot of opportunities to practice interviewing with volunteers from tech companies. I am so happy that I got to know about this amazing program and decided to join. Next week, I am going to graduate from Techtonica, and I got an internship for a back-end role in one of the Techtonica sponsor companies!'"

(THANK YOU, Techtonica!) I highly recommend this program to anyone considering it. My only recommendation would be to find support on your own if you can. Techtonica gave us a LOT of support.

Even though we're in the virtual form, Techtonica feels like a very people/team culture. You can't be a loner in the program. In general, the program is incredibly supportive, on many levels, and to many kinds of people. You're gifted with so many opportunities and space to just learn and explore, to grow and thrive. You choose how you learn but you also don't learn alone, you get to collaborate with peers, with various mentors, with industry volunteers (ie Twitter), and so much more. You can focus more on the learning process, and not endlessly chase, "what skills/project would land me a job?", along with trying to network, ultimately stretching yourself thin. You're matched with a mentor and get 1:1 help from many folks, emotional + financial + general support, lots of collaboration practice, and end up with an apprenticeship so you can get your foot in the door.'"
