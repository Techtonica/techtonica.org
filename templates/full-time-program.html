      <p class="justify">
        Techtonica's full-time software engineering training program is a free,
        virtual for 2021, year-long program that provides the opportunity for
        women and non-binary adults with low incomes to learn technical skills
        and start their first job in tech. We select participants who are
        independent but good at collaborating, motivated to succeed, committed
        to learning to code, flexible, curious, open-minded, and excited for
        long-term careers in the field, have a good attitude and a growth
        mindset, can calmly manage extended periods of frustration
        (troubleshooting is something you'll face forever in tech!), and want to
        pay it forward. We aim to empower those most underrepresented in tech
        and to help tech become more diverse and inclusive.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        92% of our participants so far have been people of color, 25% have a
        disability, 10% identify outside the gender binary, and 8% are veterans.
      </p>
      <div class="blue-background">

      </div>
      <p class="justify">
        The program runs Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (Pacific
        Time) for one year, starting with training at Techtonica starting in
        January, and followed by six months of placement or job search and
        community support. After the first trial month of full-time training,
        participants who work the hardest and meet and exceed expectations will
        be invited to continue for the next five months of training with
        stipends based upon need and funding available. (We still recommend you
        save up as much as possible as stipends may not cover all your costs.)
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Techtonica participants will learn to do full-stack web development
        using JavaScript. Upon successful completion of the program, some
        participants will be placed with available partner companies via a
        two-way interview and rating system. As of the open of the January 2021
        applications, we have seven positions for placement and will be
        accepting 10-15 participants. If you are placed with a company and you
        both meet the requirements, you may earn an OJT ("On-the-Job Training")
        certificate from the State of California's Division of Apprenticeship
        Standards.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        What bootcamps and Techtonica have in common is the fact that they are
        intensive training. However, bootcamps can be pretty passive classroom
        learning with students and they cost between $15,000 and $30,000.
        Techtonica aims to be more like the workplace to make the transition
        into the industry better—instead of having an instructor constantly
        guiding you (which you won't have in any software engineering job), you
        are given a general schedule of topics and assignments (see
        <a
          title="Curriculum"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/techtonica/curriculum"
          >our curriculum repo</a
        >
        for an idea of the resources provided) and you're expected to figure out
        what to do on your own or in collaboration with volunteers, mentors,
        tech groups, other participants, and Techtonica staff. Because our
        resources are open-source, they are continuously being improved and you
        can even make improvements as you work through them. In the best jobs,
        there are regular check-ins with very understanding managers and mentors
        provide regular support, but that is not always the case. Techtonica’s
        program is as hands-on and project-based as possible to best prepare you
        for work in tech. You'll also be expected to speak and present in front
        of people often—a very useful skill to have for a successful career.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        The schedule includes assessments to give you a reason to review what
        you've learned, to provide you with feedback on where you need to
        improve, and to prepare you for long-term success in the workplace. As
        we consider your progress, we take everything you do in the program into
        account (not just assessments)—if you're on time and present, if you're
        meeting deadlines, if you're completing assignments, if you're following
        process, if you're communicating about your needs, if you're
        consistently meeting with your mentors, if you're building your network,
        if you're collaborating well, if you're solving problems, if you're
        dealing with the stress of an intensive program well, if you're lifting
        others with you, if you're reading instructions, how your mentor feels
        you're doing, how you indicate you're doing in surveys and one-on-ones,
        etc. If we see any indications you’re struggling in one area, we look
        more closely at everything else and we work out a plan for improvement.
        Consistent problems and lack of improvement could indicate someone’s not
        ready to continue the program. The board discusses such cases to decide
        what should be done. Because of the high expectations of our program and
        partners, not everyone completes the program.
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        Intensive programs, career transitions, and learning and working with
        technical concepts—these are all stressful, difficult things. If we
        accept you to our program, we believe in your ability to step up to the
        challenge and handle stress in a healthy way, and you should believe in
        that ability and look at every new step as something preparing you for
        tech. In many ways, tech will be much harder than this program and this
        is your chance to work out how you’re going to react when faced with
        bigger challenges. Are you able to train yourself to calmly accept
        challenges, to open your minds to growth, to manage your stress levels
        in a healthy way, and to learn whatever’s needed to succeed?
