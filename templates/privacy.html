      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This policy explains how we collect and treat any information you give
        us. You won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of
        unreadable text. We’ve no desire to trick you into agreeing to something
        you might later regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal
        and business information safe. We ask for only the bare minimum from our users. We won’t use
        your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we won’t give anyone
        access to it unless they need it to conduct Techtonica’s work or we’re forced to by law.
      </p>

      <p>Our policy includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How we collect information</li>
        <li>What information we hold</li>
        <li>Where we store your information</li>
        <li>What we use your information for</li>
        <li>Contacting us about your information</li>
        <li>Who has access to information about you</li>
        <li>The steps we take to keep your information private</li>
        <li>Retention</li>
        <li>Changes to the policy</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How we collect information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We can ask for contact information including your name, email address,
          and phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track
          the websites you visit. We use Google Analytics and don’t use native
          social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also build profiles of
          your internet activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          We collect your email address when you sign up for one of our
          newsletters.
        </li>
        <li>
          We ask for your account and contact information when you hire someone
          or buy something from us.
        </li>
        <li>
          We usually collect applicant information via Google Forms, though files can be shared via
          email or video if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of
          our partners. If we do, we protect it in exactly the same way as if
          you give it to us directly.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What information we hold</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When you contact us by email, sign up for one of our events, apply for one of our 
          programs,  or submit one of our forms, we collect whichever information you’ve 
          submitted — information such as your name, email address, phone number, a social 
          media username, and the company you work for.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect the information you
          entered into the form.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and
          bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the
          payments you make.
        </li>
        <li>
          All credit card donations are processed by Flipcause, our donation
          platform, and we never have access to your credit card information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Where we store your information</h3>
      <p>
        When you do business with us in some way, participate in one of our recorded 
        events, or contact us, whether via email, form submission, social media, Slack, 
        event registration, newsletter subscription, or another method, we may store your
        information in HubSpot, Mailchimp, Google Contacts, Google Drive, Eventbrite, 
        YouTube, and/or Dropbox.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What we use your information for</h3>
      <p>
        We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of
        our products and services. When we do, you have the option to
        unsubscribe from these communications either through the unsubscribe 
        link in emails or by responding with a request and we won’t send them to you
        again. We might also contact you about our products and services, but
        if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We use your
        information to administer our programs or to send you information about 
        programming you’re indicated interest in, invoices, statements, or reminders.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Contacting us about your information</h3>
      <p>
        To contact Techtonica with questions or concerns about your information, or to 
        request the information we have from you be updated, deleted, or shared with you, 
        please contact us by emailing info at techtonica . org or submitting our contact form. 
        If you’re the letter-writing type, send your envelope to Techtonica  440 N Barranca Ave 
        #5473, Covina, CA 91723.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Who has access to information about you</h3>
      <p>
        When we store information in our systems, only the people who need
        it to do Techtonica's work have access.
      </p>
      
      <h3>The steps we take to keep your information private</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict
          access only to people who need it. We store passwords in LastPass, an
          encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated
          password for each service, and do not use the same password twice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Techtonica’s laptops are all encrypted and protected by a passcode.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Retention</h3>
      <p>
        Your information is retained as long as we still need it to administer our 
        programs or until you request it be deleted.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes to the policy</h3>
      <p>
        If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become
        effective the moment we publish them on our website.
