        Techtonica is a fiscally-sponsored nonprofit that helps U.S. women and 
        non-binary adults with low incomes overcome barriers into tech careers by
        providing free tech training, laptops, stipends, and job placement and 
        support through corporate sponsorships.

      <h3>Make an Impact as Our Partnerships Manager!</h3>

      <p class="justify">
        We are seeking a committed individual to build and manage partnerships. 
        The Partnerships Manager's work is what makes Techtonica's programs 
        possible, and it involves every step of the sales cycle and 
        beyond, but for a good cause, in a more personal way, and with the benefit of
        Techtonica's well-connected community of participants, graduates, volunteers,
        donors, partner organizations, and corporate sponsors. 
      </p>
      <p class="justify">
        This position is full-time and remote in the U.S.,
        with mostly Pacific Time business hours. Unfortunately we are unable to offer 
        visa sponsorship. With at least 8 placements to find in the next 3-4 months, 
        we hope to find someone to join the team as soon as possible and long-term to 
        grow and improve the organization with us. 
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        We are especially seeking someone who is passionate about social justice 
        and can relate to the people we serve on multiple levels: ~85% of our full-time 
        participants identify as BIPOC, and all of them are women or non-binary adults 
        with low incomes.
