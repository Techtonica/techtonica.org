<h3>What makes Techtonica different?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer underserved, diverse populations an opportunity to be involved in a long-term, tuition free, full-time program that prepares and places students in the software engineering field without having to worry about financial instability.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expose students to a </span><strong>variety of roles</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the tech industry, not solely the role of software engineer&mdash;our goal is to find great fits for our students and help them support themselves and their families</span></li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What do &ldquo;genderqueer,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;femme&rdquo; or &ldquo;femme-presenting&rdquo; mean?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genderqueer and non-binary are terms that describe people who do not identify as men or women. &ldquo;Femme&rdquo; refers to people&rsquo;s appearance. A more traditionally-feminine appearance is considered femme.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Techtonica looking for in students?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeking students who can show consistent responsibility, resilience, commitment, and interest, among other criteria that our partner companies work out with us. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I'm interested in being a student in your program. How do I sign up?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, we do not have an open application process and our students are recruited through our community organization partners and workshops we organize with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Techtonica looking for in companies?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeking companies that are interested in increasing diversity and social impact, committed to learning about and encouraging inclusion, supportive of junior engineers, etc.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is considered low-income?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most area nonprofits: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a family: less than $39,000 annually</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an individual: less than $24,000 annually</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Techtonica:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than $50,000 annually</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Is there an age limit?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults, ages 18 and up</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How long is the students' training?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our full-time program is full-time, Monday through Friday, for six months.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>When does the first class start?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May! Sponsoring companies must commit to sponsor in April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Where will classes be held?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classes will be held in San Francisco&mdash;we are currently looking for space, possibly at a sponsoring company.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Which subjects will be covered? What does the curriculum cover? What level of training do you provide?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The curriculum covers mostly web development (full-stack JavaScript), but we also do sections on other skills useful in tech, such as project management, UI/UX design, and data analysis. Sponsoring companies have a say in what should be added or improved upon. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why don&rsquo;t you just take a cut from students&rsquo; salaries following the program?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in empowering underrepresented folks, rather than placing an additional burden on them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Why does your program end with job placement?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being underrepresented and without connections in the tech industry makes it very difficult to find a job. Companies are working to increase diversity, and underprivileged locals are seeking employment, so why not help each other?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What are the sponsor levels and benefits?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See <a href="{{ url_for('render_sponsor_page') }}">our sponsorships page.</a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Do sponsors get to select students for employment?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate-level sponsors are involved with the training and curriculum, so they get to know students over the span of the six months. Around the fifth month, companies and students rate each other and we do our best to align you so both sides are happy.</a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What topics are included in the diversity and inclusion training for sponsors?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implicit bias, privilege, allyship, empathy, inclusion vs. diversity, apologizing, tools for inclusive hiring, why policies are important, giving actionable feedback, etc.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Are my donations tax-exempt?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. We are fiscally sponsored through </span><a href="http://www.socialgoodfund.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Good Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
