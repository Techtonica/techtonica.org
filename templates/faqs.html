<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is your one-sentence description of Techtonica?</h3>

<h3 id="different">What makes Techtonica different?</h3>
<p>We offer underserved, diverse populations an opportunity to be involved in a long-term, tuition free, full-time program that prepares and places apprentices in the software engineering field without having to worry about financial instability.

<li>We are a <strong>nonprofit, so donations are tax-deductible</strong></li>
<li>We provide <strong>laptops</strong></li>
<li>Our program is <strong>six months long</strong> instead of just three​</li>
<li>Our program ends with a <strong>job</strong> and <strong>professional connections</strong> in the industry</li>
<li>We expose apprentices to a <strong>variety of roles</strong> in the tech industry, not solely the role of software engineer&mdash;our goal is to find great fits for our apprentices and help them support themselves and their families</li>

<h3 id="definitions">What do &ldquo;genderqueer,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-binary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;femme&rdquo; or &ldquo;femme-presenting&rdquo; mean?</h3>
<p>Genderqueer and non-binary are terms that describe people who do not identify as men or women. &ldquo;Femme&rdquo; refers to people&rsquo;s appearance. A more traditionally-feminine appearance is considered femme. We are trans-inclusive. We serve and accept cis and trans women, as well as people with non-binary gender identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="companies">What is Techtonica looking for in companies?</h3>
<p>We are seeking companies that are interested in increasing diversity and social impact, committed to learning about and encouraging inclusion, supportive of junior engineers, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="low-income">What is considered low-income?</h3>
<p>For most area nonprofits: </p>
<p>For a family: less than $39,000 annually</p>
<p>For an individual: less than $24,000 annually</p>
<p>For Techtonica:</p>
<p>Less than $50,000 annually</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="age-limit">Is there an age limit?</h3>
<p>Adults, ages 18 and up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="duration">How long is the apprenticeship?</h3>
<p>Our apprenticeship is full-time, Monday through Friday, for six months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="where">Where will the apprenticeship take place?</h3>
<p>The apprenticeship will take place in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="subjects">Which subjects will be covered? What does the curriculum cover? What level of training do you provide?</h3>
<p>The curriculum covers mostly web development (full-stack JavaScript), but we also do sections on other skills useful in tech, such as project management, UI/UX design, and data analysis. Sponsoring companies have a say in what should be added or improved upon. Feel free to check out and contribute to <a href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum" target="_blank">our open-source curriculum</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="cut-from-salaries">Why don't you just take a cut from apprentices' salaries following the program?</h3>
<p>We believe in empowering underrepresented folks, rather than placing an additional burden on them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="job-placements">Why does your program end with job placement?</h3>
<p>Being underrepresented and without connections in the tech industry makes it very difficult to find a job. Companies are working to increase diversity, and underprivileged locals are seeking employment, so why not help each other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="sponsor-levels-and-benefits">What are the sponsor levels and benefits?</h3>
<p>See <a href="{{ url_for('render_sponsor_page') }}">our sponsorships page.</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="hiring">Do sponsors get to select apprentices for employment?</h3>
<p>Advocate-level sponsors are involved with the training and curriculum, so they get to know apprentices over the span of the six months. Around the fifth month, companies and apprentices rate each other and we do our best to align you so both sides are happy.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="topics-in-diversity-training">What topics are included in the diversity and inclusion training for sponsors?</h3>
<p>Implicit bias, privilege, allyship, empathy, inclusion vs. diversity, apologizing, tools for inclusive hiring, why policies are important, giving actionable feedback, etc.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="tax-exempt-donations">Are my donations tax-exempt?</h3>
<p>Yes. We are fiscally sponsored through <a href="http://www.socialgoodfund.org">Social Good Fund</a>. (Fiscal sponsorship is when a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization—the “fiscal sponsor”—grants its legal and tax-exempt status to a project with related services.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="how-to-donate">How do I donate?</h3>
<p>Thank you! You can donate once or regularly <a href="https://techtonica.org/donate/">here</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="name">Where did the name 'Techtonica' come from?</h3>
<p>Our founder Michelle Glauser liked the idea of Techtonica being a "tonic" or "solution" for tech and a technical solution for neighbors in need. She also likes the "moving and shaking" that the name implies. The A at the end just fits, you know?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
