    <p>
      Techtonica’s part-time fundamentals program is a free, virtual technical training 
      program provides the opportunity seeking economic empowerment to learn technical
      skills in a safe, inclusive space. We aim to empower those most underrepresented 
      in tech and to help tech become more diverse and inclusive. To that end, we have 
      been very intentional about creating a safe community, building a network, and
      providing personalized support, which means open communication is
      absolutely necessary. If a special situation comes up, we need you to let
      us know so we can sympathize and brainstorm solutions with you. We've had
      participants lose housing, have their laptop stolen, become pregnant, face
      abuse, and more, and if we don't know about it, we can't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      88% of our graduates so far are BIPOC, 21% have a disability, 21% are
      parents, 10% identify outside the gender binary, and 1% are veterans. Our
      cohorts have had between 8 and 18 participants so far, and income increase
      is usually 3-5x. The participant-to-technical-program-staff-member ratio
      has historically been between 5:1 and 9:1. We appreciate an average of 98
      hours of volunteer support per participant.

      What bootcamps and Techtonica have in common is the fact that they are
      intensive training. However, bootcamps can be pretty passive classroom
      learning with students and they cost between $1,075 and $2,200 per week
      without many scholarship opportunities. The program gives more people the 
      chance to try out coding before committing fully to a career transition 
      and and to ease the financial risk participants take on by quitting their jobs
      to do a full-time program in the current difficult job market for junior
      engineers. Techtonica aims to be more like the workplace to make the transition 
      into the industry better—instead of having an instructor constantly guiding 
      you (which you won't have in any software engineering job), you are given a 
      general schedule of topics and assignments (see
      <a
        title="Curriculum"
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/techtonica/curriculum"
        >our curriculum repo</a
      >
      for an idea of the resources provided) and you're expected to figure out
      what to do on your own or in collaboration with volunteers, mentors, tech
      groups, other participants, and Techtonica staff. Because our resources
      are open-source, they are continuously being improved and you can even
      make improvements as you work through them. In the best jobs, there are
      regular check-ins with very understanding managers and mentors provide
      regular support, but that is not always the case. Techtonica’s program is
      as hands-on and project-based as possible to best prepare you for work in
      tech. You'll also be expected to speak and present in front of people
      often — a very useful skill to have for a successful career.
    </p>
    <p> Note: In no way during the Program is the Participant employed by the 
      Organization or eligible for employee benefits such as health insurance, 
      vacation or sick pay, retirement plans, or unemployment insurance.

    <h1 class="blue-h1">The Schedule</h1>
    <p>
      The program runs Monday through Friday, 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM
      (Pacific Time) for ten weeks, with a single weekend hackathon. The 
      September 2025 cohort's length is anticipated to be 10-weeks. 
      Participants will learn foundational web development and career 
      concepts, including exposure to the PERN stack. Graduating participants 
      who work the hardest and meet and exceed expectations will be invited 
      to apply for the 
      <a href="{{ url_for('render_swe_program_page') }}">
        26-week Software Engineering program
      </a>
      which is followed by six months of remote job placement or job search and community 
      support. Participants who work the hardest and meet and exceed expectations
      will be invited to continue into the software engineering program. 
      We do not provide medical insurance, so we recommend you google 
      programs in your area (like MediCal in California). We also can't help with 
      visas, student or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For participants with ADHD, we can provide accommodations
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/underrepresented-in-tech-resources/resources-adhd.md"
        >and resources.</a
      >
      We encourage open communication around what works best for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Techtonica is not set up to provide wraparound or crisis services
      (try
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crisistextline.org/"
        >the Crisis Text Line</a
      >) such as for mental or physical health, housing, finding childcare,
      escaping abuse, etc. We encourage you to google services in your area.
      Threats of violence against yourself or others will result in us ceasing
      all contact with you and possibly initiating a welfare check.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schedule includes knowledge checks to give you a reason to review what
      you've learned, to provide you with feedback on where you need to improve,
      and to prepare you for long-term success in the workplace. As we consider
      your progress, we take everything you do in the program into account (not
      just assessments)—if you're on time and present, if you're meeting
      deadlines, if you're completing assignments, if you're following process,
      if you're communicating about your needs, if you're consistently meeting
      with your mentors, if you're building your network, if you're
      collaborating well, if you're solving problems, if you're dealing with the
      stress of an intensive program well, if you're lifting others with you, if
      you're reading instructions, how your mentor feels you're doing, how you
      indicate you're doing in surveys and one-on-ones, etc. If we see any
      indications you’re struggling in one area, we look more closely at
      everything else and we work out a plan for improvement. Consistent
      problems and lack of improvement could indicate someone’s not ready to
      continue the program. The board discusses such cases to decide what should
      be done. Because of the high expectations of our program and partners, not
      everyone completes the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intensive programs, career transitions, and learning and working with
      technical concepts—these are all stressful, difficult things. If we accept
      you to our program, we believe in your ability to step up to the challenge
      and handle stress in a healthy way, and you should believe in that ability
      and look at every new step as something preparing you for tech. In many
      ways, tech will be much harder than this program and this is your chance
      to work out how you’re going to react when faced with bigger challenges.
      Are you able to train yourself to calmly accept challenges, to open your
      minds to growth, to manage your stress levels in a healthy way, and to
      learn whatever’s needed to succeed? Do you contribute to a safe, inclusive
      environment?
