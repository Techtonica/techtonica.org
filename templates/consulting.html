    <h2>Techtonica Consulting Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Diverse Talent Pool: </strong> Techtonica Consulting harnesses
        and hones the skills and potential of underrepresented software
        engineers on the rise, improving business outcomes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessible Pricing: </strong> Projects start at just $5,000,
        making it an affordable option for organizations of all sizes, and a
        great option for pilots of ideas you’d like to test.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax Deductible: </strong> Partnerships with Techtonica are
        tax-deductible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We work with clients of any size, from Fortune 500 companies to
      community-driven, open-source projects. Our engagement rates may be as low
      as $5000, depending on required deliverables and length of time. Your
      support for the Techtonica Consulting program enriches the journey and
      development of our participants, propelling them towards their next
      milestones by equipping them with invaluable real-world technical
      experience as part of their software engineering journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participating in a Techtonica Consulting project can help streamline your
      team's workload and increase overall productivity. Techtonica Consulting
      allows you to leverage junior software engineers supervised by experienced
      senior personnel at Techtonica, effectively outsourcing specific projects
      or tasks. This delegation reduces the burden on your existing staff,
      enabling them to focus on high-priority tasks while providing valuable
      real-world experience to Techtonica graduates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Techtonica consultants are Techtonica graduates who have successfully
      completed our full-time, project-based, open-source software engineering
      training curriculum, followed by varying amounts of professional software
      engineering experience. However, a lot of organizations don't currently
      have the capacity to support entry-level talent. To continue helping those
      organizations meet their software development needs while prioritizing
      learning opportunities for participants who are finishing our program, new
      Techtonica graduates from diverse backgrounds work on real software
      projects alongside our senior software engineers. Techtonica consultants
      gain real-world software engineering consulting experience, including
      scoping projects, talking to clients, meeting deliverables, holding
      retrospectives, reviewing PRs, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Techtonica holds weekly check-ins with consultants involved in client
      projects. Consultants also have opportunities to pair or ask for advice in
      regular office hours, a weekly team meeting for each project, and a weekly
      review for all consultants. Senior software engineers review PRs and hold
      retrospectives with involved consultants. Our team also meets with yours
      to sync as needed, and shares regular updates about progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Techtonica graduates have extensive project-based experience with the
      PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, and Node). Graduates may also have
      experience in a wide variety of other technologies, and current
      consultants have used Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, C#, Go,
      Ruby, and assorted APIs on past projects. Because this is an educational
      experience, we're also very open to learning new technologies to support
      your tech stack.
    </p>
    Some projects that would be most fitting for Techtonica Consulting include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        testing and debugging (unit tests for individual components, integration
        tests for larger systems, or using debugging tools to identify and fix a
        certain class of issues),
      </li>
      <li>
        encapsulated security changes (such as implementing basic authentication
        and authorization systems or testing to prevent common web
        vulnerabilities), and
      </li>
      <li>
        general web development (such as building simple web applications,
        implementing RESTful APIs, customizing no-code applications, and payment
        system integrations).
      </li>
    </ul>
