          <h1>Why</h1>
          <p class="justify">Though many jobs are available in top tech market cities like San Francisco, companies need to build teams with more racial, gender, and class diversity. Huge income disparities also exist in these areas.</p>
          <p class="justify">Other technical training programs cost upwards of $15K, require laptops, do little to support parents and people of underrepresented genders, and provide limited transitions into the workforce.</p>
          <p class="justify">We asked, "What if we could help companies build much-needed diverse technical teams by training the people who need jobs the most?"</p>

          <h3>Vetting</h3>
          <p>Techtonica conducts free intro workshops with local organizations and labs. We ask the most engaged, understanding, collaborative, resilient, and responsible students to complete challenges and teach before we invite them to apply for the full-time program.</p>

          <h3>Partner Companies</h3>
          <p>Partner companies sponsor the training and provide mentors for the students. They have a say in the curriculum and receive inclusion training in preparation for employing one of their top-rated students at the end of the program. The sponsorship is tax-deductible.</p>

          <h3>Training</h3>
          <p>Accepted students receive living stipends, childcare if needed, and six months of full-time training that includes laptops, lectures, building assignments, projects, and experienced guidance and feedback. Upon completion of the program, they are placed with a partner company.</p>
