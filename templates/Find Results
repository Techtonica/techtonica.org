    8  The main audience of the website is made up of (potential) volunteers and
    9: sponsors. (Apprentices will be contacted via local organizations.)

   11  ### What
   12  
   13: We need to effectively communicate that Techtonica and its apprentices are worth

   16  <h3 id="different">What makes Techtonica different?</h3>
   17: <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer underserved, diverse populations an opportunity to be involved in a long-term, tuition free, full-time program that prepares and places apprentices in the software engineering field without having to worry about financial instability. The main differences between us and other programs are: </span></p>
   18  <ul>
   19: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apprentices are </span><strong>local, women and non-binary, feminine-adjacent adults with low incomes, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">preventing more displacement and empowering the people who really need tech skills</span></li>
   20: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71% of our participants so far have been <strong>people of color</strong></span></li>
   21: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program is </span><strong>free</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for apprentices</span></li>
   22: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer our apprentices</span><strong> stipends to offset living and childcare costs</strong></li>
   23  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are a </span><strong>nonprofit, so donations are tax-deductible</strong></li>
   24  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide </span><strong>laptops</strong></li>
   25  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program is </span><strong>six months long</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of just three​</span></li>
   26  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program ends with a </span><strong>job</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>professional connections</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the industry</span></li>
   27: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expose apprentices to a </span><strong>variety of roles</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the tech industry, not solely the role of software engineer&mdash;our goal is to find great fits for our apprentices and help them support themselves and their families</span></li>
   28: <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage apprentices to be </span><strong>leaders</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the community</span></li>
   29  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We organize intro coding workshops with </span><strong>local organizations</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach the local community</span></li>
   30  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our program is more </span><strong>age-inclusive</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&mdash;it's not just for young adults</span></li>
   ..
   38  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genderqueer and non-binary are terms that describe people who do not identify as men or women. &ldquo;Femme&rdquo; refers to people&rsquo;s appearance. A more traditionally-feminine appearance is considered femme.</span></p>
   39  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   40: <h3 id="students">What is Techtonica looking for in apprentices?</h3>
   41: <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeking apprentices who can show consistent responsibility, resilience, commitment, and interest, among other criteria that our partner companies work out with us. </span></p>
   42  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   43: <h3 id="sign-up">I'm interested in being an apprentice in your program. How do I sign up?</h3>
   44: <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See <a href="/apprenticeship">here</a> for more information.</span></p>
   45  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   46  <h3 id="companies">What is Techtonica looking for in companies?</h3>
   ..
   57  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults, ages 18 and up</span></p>
   58  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   59: <h3 id="duration">How long is the apprenticeship?</h3>
   60  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our apprenticeship is full-time, Monday through Friday, for six months.</span></p>
   61  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   ..
   69  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The curriculum covers mostly web development (full-stack JavaScript), but we also do sections on other skills useful in tech, such as project management, UI/UX design, and data analysis. Sponsoring companies have a say in what should be added or improved upon. </span></p>
   70  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   71: <h3 id="cut-from-salaries">Why don't you just take a cut from apprentices' salaries following the program?</h3>
   72  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in empowering underrepresented folks, rather than placing an additional burden on them. </span></p>
   73  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   ..
   78  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See <a href="{{ url_for('render_sponsor_page') }}">our sponsorships page.</a></span>
   79  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   80: <h3 id="hiring">Do sponsors get to select apprentices for employment?</h3>
   81: <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocate-level sponsors are involved with the training and curriculum, so they get to know students over the span of the six months. Around the fifth month, companies and apprentices rate each other and we do our best to align you so both sides are happy.</span>
   82  <p>&nbsp;</p>
   83  <h3 id="topics-in-diversity-training">What topics are included in the diversity and inclusion training for sponsors?</h3>
