    <p>
      Techtonica's programs are virtual technical training programs that provide
      the opportunity for those seeking economic empowerment to learn technical
      skills in a safe, inclusive space. We aim to empower those most
      underrepresented in tech and to help tech become more diverse and
      inclusive. To that end, we have been very intentional about creating a
      safe community, building a network, and providing personalized support,
      which means open communication is absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      We select participants who are independent but good at collaborating,
      motivated to succeed, committed to learning to code, flexible, curious,
      open-minded, and excited for long-term careers in the field, have a good
      attitude and a growth mindset, can calmly manage extended periods of
      frustration and want to pay it forward.
