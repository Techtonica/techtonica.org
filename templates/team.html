      <p class="justify">
        Since becoming a software engineer in 2012, she's worked for a better,
        more diverse software industry by organizing support groups, meetups,
        workshops, and the #ILookLikeAnEngineer ad campaign. Michelle's
        experience working in tech and volunteering in the community in San
        Francisco revealed two glaring issues: lack of diversity on tech teams
        and high income disparity. Techtonica is her vision to help tech
        companies and people who need more opportunities thrive together.

      <p class="justify">
        Amanda started her professional career as a field organizer for political
        campaigns and quickly realized she enjoyed mobilizing people and supporting
        initiatives that uplifted the marginalized and disenfranchised communities.
        Amanda has spent several years doing just that as a city planner and corporate
        fundraiser. Amanda’s mission is to open doors and make room at tables, once out
        of reach for people like her. Outside of work, Amanda serves on the board of two
        local nonprofits in Greenville, South Carolina, and enjoys spending time with her
        family and friends. Amanda is excited to be in a space that speaks to her personal
        mission and is ready to continue to build upon the inclusive tech ecosystem at
        Techtonica.

        decided to focus her career in mobile development. Cristina likes the
        problem-solving aspect of being a software engineer, and she enjoys
        using all her research skills to find the answer to any new challenge in
        the development of a project. She is passionate about building projects
