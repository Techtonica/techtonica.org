      <p class="justify">
        Since becoming a software engineer in 2012, she's worked for a better,
        more diverse software industry by organizing support groups, meetups,
        workshops, and the #ILookLikeAnEngineer ad campaign. Michelle's
        experience working in tech and volunteering in the community in San
        Francisco revealed two glaring issues: lack of diversity on tech teams
        and high income disparity. Techtonica is her vision to help tech
        companies and people who need more opportunities thrive together.

        Tiffany has over 10 years of professional experience working in social
        impact. Prior to joining Techtonica, she managed a STEM and
        Environmental Education program for youth from communities that
        organizations have previously failed to engage. She is an experienced
        community builder and is impassioned about diversity, equity, and
        inclusion across all sectors. She is now excited to help create an
        inclusive tech ecosystem through partnership and relationship building.

        her path from communications to software engineering. And in 2018, she
        decided to focus her career in mobile development. Cristina likes the
        problem-solving aspect of being a software engineer, and she enjoys
        using all her research skills to find the answer to any new challenge in
        the development of a project. She is passionate about building projects
        from scratch in React Native and publishing apps to IOs and Android. She

        management and programming skillset.
