      <p class="justify">
        Since becoming a software engineer in 2012, she's worked for a better,
        more diverse software industry by organizing support groups, meetups,
        workshops, and the #ILookLikeAnEngineer ad campaign. Michelle's
        experience working in tech and volunteering in the community in San
        Francisco revealed two glaring issues: lack of diversity on tech teams
        and high income disparity. Techtonica is her vision to help tech
        companies and people who need more opportunities thrive together.
