    <p>
      Techtonica’s part-time, virtual, intensive Software Engineering Program provides 
      women and non-binary adults seeking economic empowerment the opportunity to 
      learn technical skills that prepare for a career transition into tech in a safe, 
      inclusive space. The Program is made up of two parts: the introductory Part I: 
      Web Dev Foundations (September-December) and the advanced Part II: Software Applications (January-June). 
    </p>
    <p>
      The program takes place Monday through Friday, 5 PM to 9 PM Pacific Time 
      (20 hours per week) and includes some weekend hackathons. Part I: Web Dev Foundations 
      consists of four weeks of pre-work followed by ten weeks of free group learning about web 
      development fundamentals important to tech careers. Participants who perform the best 
      during Part I will be invited to join Part II: Software Applications, which consists 
      of 26 weeks of more advanced, project-based, personalized learning. Part II also has individual
      mentors, tuition (with need-based, sliding-scale, subsidized tuition and stipend scholarships 
      available), and is followed by job placement or job search support.

      What Makes Techtonica Different
    </h1>
    <p>
      Techtonica provides an intensive, inexpensive, personalized learning 
      experience for the active learner in contrast to the passive classroom 
      learning and expense of coding bootcamps. Our part-time program was 
      devised to allow participants to continue to work during the day, thus 
      easing the financial risk participants take on by quitting their jobs to 
      do the full-time program in the current difficult job market for junior 
      engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Techtonica aims to be more like the workplace to make the transition into 
      the industry better — instead of having an instructor constantly guiding 
      you (which you won't have in any software engineering job), you are given 
      a general schedule of topics and assignments (see 
      <a
        title="Curriculum"
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/techtonica/curriculum"
        >our curriculum repo</a
      > for 
      an idea of the resources provided) and you're expected to figure out what 
      to do on your own or in collaboration with other participants, volunteers, 
      mentors, tech groups, and Techtonica staff. Because our resources are 
      open-source, they are continuously being improved and you can even make 
      improvements as you work through them. In the best jobs, there are regular 
      check-ins with very understanding managers and mentors provide regular 
      support, but that is not always the case. Techtonica’s program is as 
      hands-on and project-based as possible to best prepare you for work in 
      tech. You'll also be expected to speak and present in front of people 
      often — a very useful skill to have for a successful career. The limited, 
      not-guaranteed placements we secure also set Techtonica apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      88% of our graduates so far are BIPOC, 21% have a disability, 21% are 
      parents, 10% identify outside the gender binary, and 1% are veterans. 
      Our cohorts have had between 8 and 18 participants so far, and income 
      increase is usually 3-5x. Techtonica’s small-but-dedicated team, board 
      members, and volunteers provide personalized support.
    </p>

        alt="Various logo images of full stack web development technology taught within the curriculum"
        class="full-width-img"
      />

    <p>
      The schedule includes knowledge checks to give you a reason to review 
      what you've learned, to provide you with feedback on where you need to 
      improve, and to prepare you for long-term success in the workplace. As 
      we consider your progress, we take everything you do in the program into 
      account (not just assessments)—if you're on time and present, if you're 
      meeting deadlines, if you're completing assignments, if you're following 
      process, if you're communicating about your needs, if you're consistently 
      meeting with your mentors, if you're building your network, if you're 
      collaborating well, if you're solving problems, if you're dealing with 
      the stress of an intensive program well, if you're lifting others with 
      you, if you're reading instructions, how your mentor feels you're doing, 
      how you indicate you're doing in surveys and one-on-ones, etc. If we see 
      any indications you’re struggling in one area, we assess the overall 
      picture and work out a plan for improvement. Consistent problems and 
      lack of improvement could indicate someone’s not ready to continue the 
      program. Because of limited capacity and the high expectations of our 
      program and partners, not everyone completes the program. About 50% of 
      people who successfully complete Part I of the program will be accepted 
      to Part II.

      We aim to empower those most underrepresented in tech and to help tech
      become more diverse and inclusive. To that end, we have been very
      intentional about creating a safe community, building a network, and
      providing personalized support, which means open communication is
      absolutely necessary. If a special situation comes up, we need you to let
      us know so we can sympathize and brainstorm solutions with you. We've had
      participants lose housing, have their laptop stolen, become pregnant, face
      abuse, and more, and if we don't know about it, we can't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limited laptops are available to rent for this program (we will reach out 
      to accepted applicants to make arrangements).

      frustration (troubleshooting is something you'll face forever in tech!), 
      and want to pay it forward.

        <li>prefer always being told exactly what to do</li>
        <li>won't prioritize your participation in the program</li>
        <li>

        <li>aren't sure if you want to be a software engineer</li>

      If you are not accepted the first time you apply, you may apply two more times for a
      maximum of three times, and those do not have to be consecutive
      application rounds. If you have any special circumstances that make you
      question your eligibility for Techtonica’s program, please feel free to
      contact us and we will be happy to discuss with you. If you are
      interested in Techtonica but cannot participate in the next cohort,

      Part II: Software Applications Specifics
    </h1>
    <p>
      Part II: Software Applications will accept 10-15 participants from those 
      who successfully completed Part I and will begin in January 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon successful completion of Part II of the program, some participants may 
      be placed in paid technical positions with partner companies, but there is 
      no guarantee this will happen. If you are placed with a company and you both 
      meet the requirements, you may earn an OJT ("On-the-Job Training") certificate 
      from the State of California's Division of Apprenticeship Standards.

    <h3>Tuition & Scholarships for Part II</h3>
    <p>
      As many companies have changed their priorities over the last few years, Techtonica 
      has had difficulty relying only on a corporate sponsorship model. As a result, 
      Techtonica adopted a tuition-based model with need-based, sliding-scale, subsidized 
      tuition and stipend scholarships to enable the program to serve more participants, 
      in addition to continuing to seek sponsorships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full tuition for Part II: Software Applications is $14,000 when paid upfront or $15,000 
      with six monthly payments of $2,500. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Techtonica adopted tuition, 93% of participants have been eligible for need-based, 
      sliding-scale tuition and stipend scholarships. If you will not have $15,000 beyond six 
      months of living costs, you are eligible to apply for a partial or full scholarship. 
      If you will not be able to cover tuition or six months of living costs, you are eligible 
      to apply for a tuition scholarship as well as a monthly stipend. Only those determined 
      to be in need of full scholarships will be considered for monthly stipends.
