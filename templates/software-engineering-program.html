    <p>
      Techtonica’s part-time twenty-six week program is virtual full stack software 
      engineering accelerator training program provides the opportunity seeking economic 
      empowerment to continue learning and applying technical skills in a safe, 
      inclusive space and start their first jobs in tech. We select participants 
      who are independent but good at collaborating, motivated to succeed, committed 
      to learning to code, flexible, curious, open-minded, and excited for long-term 
      careers in the field, have a good attitude and a growth mindset, can calmly 
      manage extended periods of frustration (troubleshooting is something you'll 
      face forever in tech!), and want to pay it forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to empower those most underrepresented in tech and to help tech
      become more diverse and inclusive. To that end, we have been very
      intentional about creating a safe community, building a network, and
      providing personalized support, which means open communication is
      absolutely necessary. If a special situation comes up, we need you to let
      us know so we can sympathize and brainstorm solutions with you. We've had
      participants lose housing, have their laptop stolen, become pregnant, face
      abuse, and more, and if we don't know about it, we can't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      88% of our graduates so far are BIPOC, 21% have a disability, 21% are
      parents, 10% identify outside the gender binary, and 1% are veterans. Our
      cohorts have had between 8 and 18 participants so far, and income increase
      is usually 3-5x. The participant-to-technical-program-staff-member ratio
      has historically been between 5:1 and 9:1. We appreciate an average of 98
      hours of volunteer support per participant.

      Needs-Based, Sliding Scale Tuition & Stipend Scholarships
    </h1>
    <p>
      As many companies have changed their priorities over the last few years,
      Techtonica has had difficulty relying on a corporate sponsorship model. As
      a result, Techtonica is adopting a tuition-based model with need-based,
      sliding-scale, subsidized tuition and stipend scholarships to enable the
      program to serve more participants, in addition to continuing to seek
      sponsorships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuition is $18,000. The total cost has been subsidized to lower the price
      to an amount that is less expensive than other programs at a cost of
      $1,000 per week (from Hackbright at $1,075/week to General Assembly at
      $2,183/week). Tuition paid upfront receives a 15% overall discount. For
      example, the full $18,000 cost of tuition when paid upfront with the 15%
      discount comes out to $15,300.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you will not have $18,000 beyond 6 months of living costs, you are
      eligible to apply for a partial or full scholarship. If you will not be
      able to cover tuition or 6 months of living costs, you are eligible to
      apply for a tuition scholarship as well as a monthly stipend. Only those
      determined to be in need of full scholarships will be considered for
      monthly stipends. At present, 90-95% of past applicants would have been
      eligible for the needs-based, sliding-scale tuition and stipend
      scholarships with today’s model.
    </p>
    <p>
      What bootcamps and Techtonica have in common is the fact that they are
      intensive training. However, bootcamps can be pretty passive classroom
      learning with students and they cost between $1,075 and $2,200 per week
      without many scholarship opportunities. Techtonica aims to be more like
      the workplace to make the transition into the industry better—instead of
      having an instructor constantly guiding you (which you won't have in any
      software engineering job), you are given a general schedule of topics and
      assignments (see
      <a
        title="Curriculum"
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/techtonica/curriculum"
        >our curriculum repo</a
      >
      for an idea of the resources provided) and you're expected to figure out
      what to do on your own or in collaboration with volunteers, mentors, tech
      groups, other participants, and Techtonica staff. Because our resources
      are open-source, they are continuously being improved and you can even
      make improvements as you work through them. In the best jobs, there are
      regular check-ins with very understanding managers and mentors provide
      regular support, but that is not always the case. Techtonica’s program is
      as hands-on and project-based as possible to best prepare you for work in
      tech. You'll also be expected to speak and present in front of people
      often—a very useful skill to have for a successful career.
    </p>
    <p>Note: In no way during the Program is the Participant employed by the 
      Organization or eligible for employee benefits such as health insurance, 
      vacation or sick pay, retirement plans, or unemployment insurance.

    <h1 class="blue-h1">The Schedule</h1>
    <p>
      The January 2026 program runs Monday through Friday, 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM
      (Pacific Time) is anticipated to be 26-weeks, with a three to four weekend hackathons.
      The training is followed by six months of remote job placement or job
      search and community support. Participants who work the hardest and meet
      and exceed expectations will be invited to continue.  We do not provide medical insurance,
      so we recommend you google programs in your area (like MediCal in
      California). We also can't help with visas, student or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For participants with ADHD, we can provide accommodations
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/underrepresented-in-tech-resources/resources-adhd.md"
        >and resources.</a
      >
      We encourage open communication around what works best for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Techtonica is not set up to provide wraparound or crisis services
      (try
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crisistextline.org/"
        >the Crisis Text Line</a
      >) such as for mental or physical health, housing, finding childcare,
      escaping abuse, etc. We encourage you to google services in your area.
      Threats of violence against yourself or others will result in us ceasing
      all contact with you and possibly initiating a welfare check.
    </p>
    <p>
      Techtonica participants will learn to do full-stack web development using
      JavaScript. Upon successful completion of the program, some participants
      will be placed with available partner companies via a two-way interview
      and rating system. We aim to accept 12-20 participants to each cohort. If
      you are placed with a company and you both meet the requirements, you may
      earn an OJT ("On-the-Job Training") certificate from the State of
      California's Division of Apprenticeship Standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schedule includes knowledge checks to give you a reason to review what
      you've learned, to provide you with feedback on where you need to improve,
      and to prepare you for long-term success in the workplace. As we consider
      your progress, we take everything you do in the program into account (not
      just assessments)—if you're on time and present, if you're meeting
      deadlines, if you're completing assignments, if you're following process,
      if you're communicating about your needs, if you're consistently meeting
      with your mentors, if you're building your network, if you're
      collaborating well, if you're solving problems, if you're dealing with the
      stress of an intensive program well, if you're lifting others with you, if
      you're reading instructions, how your mentor feels you're doing, how you
      indicate you're doing in surveys and one-on-ones, etc. If we see any
      indications you’re struggling in one area, we look more closely at
      everything else and we work out a plan for improvement. Consistent
      problems and lack of improvement could indicate someone’s not ready to
      continue the program. The board discusses such cases to decide what should
      be done. Because of the high expectations of our program and partners, not
      everyone completes the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intensive programs, career transitions, and learning and working with
      technical concepts—these are all stressful, difficult things. If we accept
      you to our program, we believe in your ability to step up to the challenge
      and handle stress in a healthy way, and you should believe in that ability
      and look at every new step as something preparing you for tech. In many
      ways, tech will be much harder than this program and this is your chance
      to work out how you’re going to react when faced with bigger challenges.
      Are you able to train yourself to calmly accept challenges, to open your
      minds to growth, to manage your stress levels in a healthy way, and to
      learn whatever’s needed to succeed? Do you contribute to a safe, inclusive
      environment?
