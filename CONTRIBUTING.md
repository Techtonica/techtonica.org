# Step 3: Finding an Issue to Work On

## External Hackathon Participants
- **Follow Step 1 and Step 2 above**
- If you are new to how to contribute to GitHub projects, review the [GSSoC guide](https://github.com/GSSoC24/Contributor/tree/main/gssoc-guidelines), [program staff](https://techtonica.org/team/), or talk to a Techtonica mentor via slack
   - [Issues tagged with GSSoC](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Agssoc%20no%3Aassignee)
   - [Issues tagged with ODHack14](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AODHack14%20no%3Aassignee)
   - [Issues tagged with Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AHacktoberfest%20no%3Aassignee)
   - [Issues tagged with GHC](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AGHC%20no%3Aassignee)

## Techtonica Volunteers
- Find any [unassigned open issue](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20no%3Aassignee)

## All Contributors
- If you find an issue that sounds interesting to you and you have the knowledge to complete it...
  - **Confirm no one is already assigned to it has in-progress work**
  - **Confirm no one has commented already asking to be assigned** - assignments are assigned to the first commenter
- Leave a comment stating the following:
  - [ ] Formally ask to be assigned to the issue (feel free to follow it up with a slack message).
  - [ ] Formally acknowledge that you agree to the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16LUxODmHN3N2r4GPA-YeNgXP0MIQCl6gW_twJralb5w/edit?tab=t.0).
  - [ ] Include confirmation that you have filled out the [Volunteer Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW0mo-Dpsig70374UEPvzexpas-31Ost_HsFwm0kjNOxtbtg/viewform?c=0&w=1)
  - [ ] Include any clarification questions you may have after reading the description. Specific questions work better, e.g. "Which file should change?" rather than asking a broader question such as requesting "an explanation" or "more details"
- Once you have been assigned on the issue, **do not request assignment to any other issues until you have opened a Pull Request**. If you changed your mind and would rather work on a different one, comment on the originally assigned issue to request to be **unassigned**
- Create a pull request of the changes requested by completing the prompted pull request template.
- Review our [Style Guide](https://github.com/Techtonica/techtonica.org/wiki#links-to-styling-guides) to make sure your changes conform to it.

üéóÔ∏è _**Please note, all repo support will operate within U.S. Pacific Timezone.**_

## Working on your Issue
- Comment in the issue directly if you have a question (feel free to follow it up with a slack message).
- People are welcome to team up on an issue. If you see someone is already assigned but you want to help, leave the other assignee a message on the issue about collaborating.
- Please note any time senstive due dates or labels! Any amount of help is appreciated, but if the deadline approaches and you won't be able to complete it, please leave a comment about your progress and unassign yourself from the issue so someone else can pick it up. If you forked the repo, go ahead and make a pull request with what you have.
